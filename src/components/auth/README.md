# Folder separation logic

- Components which is used only in [sign-in](<../../app/(auth)/sign-in/page.tsx>) or [sign-up](<../../app/(auth)/sign-up/page.tsx>) pages must be placed here in appropriate folder (`sign-in` related components [here](./sign-in), and `sign-up` related components [here](./sign-up))

- Do not forget, we add more likely UI parts of component here, not type declarations, auth logic or etc.
