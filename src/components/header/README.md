# Rules

- When auth-header and public-header is designed and implemented, may they include a lot of other components. So, we must separate them into two sub-folders.

- Add `auth-header` and `public-header` folders in [header](../header/) folder and put appropriate parts in them (when needed).

- Do not forget, we add more likely UI parts of component here, not type declarations, auth logic or etc.
